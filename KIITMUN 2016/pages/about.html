<h3>KIIT International MUN 2016</h3>

KIIT International Model United Nations 2016 will be the fourth installment to what has been three excellent sessions of the same in the years 2K13, 2K14 and 2K15. Coming this October and November, we wish to create a benchmark and stand as the World’s largest MUN with 25 intense committees and with an expected Delegate turnout of over 2500, after having successfully achieved the milestone, of being the Asia’s Largest MUN in 2015; with a total registered delegate footfall of above 1800.
 
<br>In this session of the KIIT International Model United Nations 2016, we are simulating twenty three committees and the international press, the details of which shall be revealed very soon. We shall also be hosting eminent personalities for Guest Lectures and let you unwind after a hard day in the committee room through the array of social events planned for the evenings of all the three days.
 
<br>We believe that in today’s world, it is important for the youth to be aware of global issues and also be a force to reckon with when it comes to shaping up world policies. This year we offer more than just a conventional Model United Nations. We offer the student community, a glorious opportunity to introspect and find the leaders among themselves.

<br>With over a dozen of collaborations all across the globe, KIITMUN has recently joined hands with the prestigious Moscow International Model United Nations (MIMUN). We are expecting some cold weather to chill the ambiance with some dramatic MUNing experience and exquisite socials.
Not to forget that, WINTER IS COMING.	
<br><br> <h3>Previous Editions</h3>

In its previous three editions KIIT International MUN has reached heights which very few MUN Conferences around the world have achieved. In its first edition as the KIIT Model United Nations it hosted just a little over 500 delegates and members of the international press across  5 committees. The conference was graced among others by by His Excellency Dr. J. N. Mishra, Ambassador of India to Portugal & Dr. Deepa Prasad, State Programme Officer, UNFPA, Odisha The closing ceremony was attended by Barrister Ms. Linda Hunter & Prof. J. Martin Hunter, Barrister, Essex Court Chambers. Delegates from institutions across the country ranging from the IITs to the various National Law Universities took steps towards becoming the leaders of tomorrow. If their messages at the end of the Social Night were to be believed we gave some of them the “best time of their college lives”; which looking back, was just the encouragement we needed for the 2014 edition.

<br>With goals set high the now 80 member secretariat set off 6 months prior to the event. This time the event was rechristened the KIIT International MUN 2014 due to presence of Delegates from the countries of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Bangladesh, etc. The event saw a record participation of 1235 delegates and members of the press across 10 committees and ended as one of the World’s largest Model UNs in terms of delegate count. It was graced among others by UNIC Director, Ms. Kiran Mehra Kerpelmann, who apart from speaking in the inaugural ceremony, also hosted a film festival and opened a UN Reading Room in Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences.

<br>The elite privilege for the delegates, found its way when they realized the chance to interact with Padmashri Rajat Sharma, the Founder Editor-In-Chief of India TV who regaled the audience with his life story and quips on the Indian political scenario! 
The three days also saw delegates from various corners of the world socializing and networking across the three social events planned after committees ended each day. If the testimonials that poured in are to be believed, this time, we gave the delegates some delicate memories that might just have become a significant part of their college nostalgia.

<br>Becoming Asia’s largest MUN was accomplished in 2015 when world class delegates from over 10 countries witnessed the glory of the 3-day conference, with good food, crazy socials with demonstration of intense debating and diplomacy skills. But that was not it, at all. Then we had some benevolent discussion with Mr. Suhel Seth followed by epitome of classy humor by the famous stand-up comedian, Kanan Gill.

<br>Well for 2016, we have our fingers crossed and working hard to consolidate our efforts, not just to win the title of becoming the largest globally but also to win hearts.

<br><h3>KIIT University</h3> 

The journey of KIIT University from a technical institute to a multi-disciplinary University is fascinating. The small engineering college of yesteryears has now transformed into a world class university spread over 25kms of land accommodating 20 lush green sprawling campuses in a built-up area of 400 acres. The university has 28 constituent schools offering more than 100 programs to over 20,000 students. It is not the world class infrastructure alone but the quality teaching and research illustrated by the accreditation of NAAC of UGC and NBA of AICTE, and MHRD status A by Government of India that make KIIT one of the most promising centers of excellence. 
<br>The KIIT educational conglomerate is unique in offering a wide spectrum of academic programs from kinder-garten to Post Graduate level, earning it a place in the Limca Book of Records. Founded by Dr. Achyuta Samanta, KIIT is a home to students from all over the country and nearly 600 students from 22 other countries. These students engage themselves in various activities through the 16 different societies. 
<br>With the formation of Student Activity Centre, the campuses are buzzing with extra-curricular activities.
<br><h3>Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS)</h3>

Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) is the humane face of KIIT. It is the world’s largest school for tribal children and provides education from KG to PG completely free of cost and is also the home of 20,000 tribal children. This slice of heaven is not created by a man who has enough to donate nor funded by any agency; government, non-government or corporate but by an individual who had lost his father at the tender age of four and began a life ridden with abject poverty and had to endure many social and economic challenges himself. He is none other than Dr. Achyuta Samanta who nurtured a dream to eradicate the sufferings of the socially challenged tribal children from the country.
<br>Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) started with just 125 tribal children way back in 1993 has grown into the largest residential institute in the world for 20,000 tribal children.  It is a total transformation of these children and indeed a revolutionary endeavour aimed at empowering the poorest of the poor and the underprivileged tribal children through holistic education. 
<br>The KIIT Group of Institutions serves as a supporting ecosystem to the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences which makes it the largest not for profit educational conglomerate in India.
<br><br><b><i>“Giving Education to the poor is like giving sight to the blind.”
<br>- Dr. Achyuta Samanta</i></b>

<h3>KIIT & KISS –‘A Synergy’</h3>

As defined in one of the major agendas of the UN, Transforming Our World -2030 is the set of goals to be achieved by 2030 for sustainable development. ‘End poverty in all forms and everywhere’ is the foremost agenda which less stress on poverty alleviation. The most important step towards this aim is impartment of education to all. This vision has been followed for the last 20 years by the KIIT and KISS synergy at a young and enchanting city of India, Bhubaneswar. 
<br>Today, KISS is not just a gracious example of poverty alleviation through education but also an ideal blueprint for the upcoming methods of implementation of the prime sustainable development goal.
KIIT and KISS together are not just an example effective and constructive youth development through quality education but also responsible for the economic growth of the city and the state at large. The real estate and market quality have significantly developed in the region. The various exchange programs and UN study programs has brought the city and state to the maps of the world and students from the international community are looking to study and understand poverty and related issues to the core. 
<br>The dreams that poverty had darkened through its dullness are now being lightened up through the light of education.   

<h3>Incredible India</h3> 

India is the seventh largest country in the world with the fastest growing free market democracy. It is on the fulcrum of an ever-increasing growth curve. 
<br>India is an incredible country – a kaleidoscope of images and experiences that overwhelm you from the moment you arrive. A country endowed with natural beauty, inspiring spirituality, rich in history and culture and identified as a New Age economy and Business Hub. These divergent sobriquets define the strange and desirable amalgam that is India. 
<br>Borrowing from a rich and colourful past and racing into the 21st century comes easily to this vast country. India demonstrates how best to harmonise the coexistence of ancient with contemporary, evident in old monuments rubbing shoulders with awesome tall skyscrapers; in the fusion of traditional fashion with urban couture; in international fast food balanced by delicious Indian cuisine, that leaves gourmets asking for more. India has fascinated people from all over the world with her secularism and her culture. There are historical monuments, beaches, places of religious interests, hill resorts, etc. that attract tourists. Every region is identified with its handicraft, fairs, folk dances, music and its people. India is an epitome of traditional outlook with a modern twist. This is a country proud of its past and ready to build on its future with 21st century vision. 
<h3>The Land of Temples</h3>
Situated on the Southern-east India, Odisha is popularly known as “The Land of Temples.” Orissa's eclectic combination of temples and architectural attractions is growing. Orissa offers picturesque national parks and wildlife, unpolluted beaches, traditional music and dance, temples, handicrafts, tribal culture, and Buddhist relics. The capital city of Orissa, Bhubaneshwar is most famous for its temples (there are over 700, mostly devoted to Lord Shiva) including the largest temple in the state -- the Lingraj Mandir. Another interesting sight of the enchanting Odisha is the sunrise over Udaygiri.
<br>Odisha is not only an epitome of architectural beauty, but also a state renowned for its handicrafts. The specialties are Pattachitra paintings and colourful applique works. They are interesting places to interact with the artisans, see demonstrations, and of course buy their beautiful handicrafts too. From Puri Beaches to the Buddhist sites, Chilika Lake to the Tribal Villages, Odisha's vast expanses of un-spoilt natural landscape and beaches has been its ability to offer a protected yet natural diversity to the state's incredible culture.
