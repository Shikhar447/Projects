		As business leaders strive for increased competitiveness, creating an entrepreneurial culture has <br /> become an important advantage. In the current business environment, the term entrepreneurial<br/> has come to mean more than just the business acumen required to turn an idea into an enterprise.<br /> Today, "entrepreneurial" describes a skill and mind-set characterized by innovation, creativity,<br /> calculated risk-taking, and an empowered staff.

		</p><br/><br/>
		
		<p style="color:black;">
		Fostering entrepreneurship in the developing world is a difficult task. But many face similar <br/>problems in this regard. Typical wish lists include better access to financing, mentorship or training <br/>and methods for finding and retaining talent.</p><br/><br/>

		<p style="color:black;">Like most business solutions, the starting point is leadership. People take their cue from their <br />leaders. Their values, priorities, and actions are guided by what their superiors model. It sounds <br />simple, but it's true. The senior executives set the tone for what the company should be doing, <br />what the organizational values should be, and how people should act .</p><br /><br />

		<p style="color:black;">Second, the technology - today we think of technology as being about electronics, but we would <br />suggest that smart entrepreneurs still view technology—in whatever form—as a means to an end,<br /> and not an end of itself. Successful entrepreneurs—those who have a clear concept of what they<br /> are trying to accomplish—leverage technology in order to help them achieve their goals more<br /> quickly. In order to ascertain which technology will align with their goals, entrepreneurs must have<br /> a very open and inquisitive bias towards technology.</p><br /><br />

		<p style="color:black;">Also, we understand the importance of given the role of academia and professional  in developing<br /> entrepreneurship for sustainable development of entrepreneurs, the aim of this Conclave for<br /> Entrepreneurship, Leadership and Technology ( CELT ) is to provide a common platform to <br />researchers, scholars and practitioners to address issues relating to the subjects mentioned above <br />and entrepreneurial management in overall .
